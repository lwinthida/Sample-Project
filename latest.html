      <p><i>Shwe Zin Moe, 2009 </i><br>The need to protect database would be an ever-growing one especially in this age of e-commerce.Many conventional database security systems are bugged with holes that can be used by attackers to penetrate the database.No matter what degree of security is put in place, sensitive data in database are still vulnerable to attack.To avoid the risk posed by this  threat, database encryption has  been recommended.However,encrypting all of database item will greatly degrade the performance of the database system.As an optimal solution, this system presents a database encryption scheme that provides maximum security,whilst limiting the added time cost of encryption and decryption.To implement the system, MARS Encryption Algorithm is used for encryption and decryption of the database. It will also genetrate the keys.This system will be implemented and developed by using JAVA Programming Language.

      <span class="title"><b>Image retrieving based on ontology</b></span>
      <p><i>Ye Lin Oo, 2009</i> <br>Today,retrieving desired images from the large database are required in the world. The current most desirable image retrieval feature is retrieving images based on their semantic contents. Semantic Contents are the scientific study of the meanings and the development of meaning of words.To understand the semantic contents and to standardize the image description.Ontology-Based Image Retrieval approach is used and  which is allowed the similarity between the attributes of images and  retrieval query to be computed accurately.Ontology is the term used to describe and represent an area of knowledge. The proposed system helps  the system user(e.g. Zoologist) to store new image,edit the attributes of existing one,view the  list and can retrieve the images of Mammals by entering the user’s desired keyword(e.g.”BobCats” to search the area of Wild-Cat Mammal).In this thesis,the image attributes from multiple images are integrated by using pre-defined ontology,which can support the effective mechanisms for image retrieval based on their semantic contents.The system is implemented by C#,RDF,XML and SemWeb class library.

      <span class="title"><b>Analysis of fractal image compression</b></span>
      <p><i>Mya Thinzar Wai, 2009</i> <br>Image compression is not only a popular research area of image  processing but also an essential portion of image transmission in massive digital image storage.Compression may be either lossy or lossless compression.In this thesis,main theory is fractal compression.The basic theories which require compressing an image are iterated function system(IFS),partitioned iterated function system(PIFS),contractive affine mapping theore m,and root mean square(RMS) error.Fractal image compression is a lossy compression method which can produce a much smaller compressed file than some lossless methods.Fractal  image compression explored the self similarity property of a natural image and utilizes the partitioned iterated function system (PIFS) to encode it.This thesis is aimed to develop the fractal image compression system by using contractive affine transformation.Compression is performed by locating self-similar sections of an image,then using a fractal algorithm to genetrate the sections.The method is best suited for photographs of natural scenes (trees,cloud and mountains),security and medical imaging applications.This system is analyzed in root mean square(RMS) error,compression ratio,compression time,decompression time,peak signal and noise ratio(PSNR),signal and noise ratio(SNR) and image quality.

      <span class="title"><b>Digital image watermarking and compression</b></span>
      <p><i> Win Htun, 2009</i><br>The growth of networked multimedia data such as images has complicated for authentication,copyright protection,broadcasting and integrity.Digital image watermarking is effective approach to distribute picture over the internet with privacy.Image compression is  also needed to transmit over  the World Wide Web.This thesis is aimed to develop the digital image watermarking and compression system.The output of the system displays whether the watermark can be detect or not.The compressed and uncompressed of watermarked images are analyzed, the similarity measure in our testing images.An effective watermark must withstand image compression,because images placed on the Internet or in database are almost always compressed  -sometimes  to a very low data rate.Since compression tends to weaken  a watermark in an image,it is important to find ways to maximize the amount of  watermark that remains in the image after compression.Common image adaptive watermarks operate in the transform domain(DCT or wavelet);the same domains are also used for popular image compression techniques.
